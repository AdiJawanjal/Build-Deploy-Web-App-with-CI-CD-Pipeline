# ðŸš€ Netflix Application â€“ DevOps Pipeline ðŸš€

This is my **first DevOps project** where I built a complete CI/CD pipeline to deploy a Netflix application on AWS, fully automated from infrastructure provisioning to monitoring.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The goal of this project was to gain **hands-on experience** with infrastructure automation, continuous integration, continuous deployment, and observability.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack & Tools
- **Terraform HCP** â€“ Provisioned AWS EC2 instances
- **Jenkins** â€“ CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Maven** â€“ Build management
- **Nexus** â€“ Artifact repository
- **Tomcat Server** â€“ Application hosting
- **Grafana & Prometheus** â€“ Monitoring and observability

## ðŸ“‚ Project Workflow
1. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** â€“ Used Terraform HCP to provision EC2 instances automatically.
2. **Continuous Integration** â€“ Jenkins pipeline pulls code from GitHub, builds it with Maven, and pushes artifacts to Nexus.
3. **Continuous Deployment** â€“ Jenkins deploys the artifact to Tomcat Server on the EC2 instance.
4. **Monitoring** â€“ Prometheus collects metrics, Grafana visualizes them for real-time insights.
